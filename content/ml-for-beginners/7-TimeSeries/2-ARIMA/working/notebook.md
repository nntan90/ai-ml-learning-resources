# Time series forecasting with ARIMA

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to:
- prepare time series data for training an ARIMA time series forecasting model
- implement a simple ARIMA model to forecast the next HORIZON steps ahead (time *t+1* through *t+HORIZON*) in the time series
- evaluate the model 


The data in this example is taken from the GEFCom2014 forecasting competition<sup>1</sup>. It consists of 3 years of hourly electricity load and temperature values between 2012 and 2014. The task is to forecast future values of electricity load. In this example, we show how to forecast one time step ahead, using historical load data only.
