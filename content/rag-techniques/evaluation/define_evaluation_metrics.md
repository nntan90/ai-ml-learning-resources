Evaluate the correctness of the generated answer compared to the ground truth.

any score between 0 and 1 is acceptable and depends on how correct the generated answer is.

```python
faithfulness_prompt = PromptTemplate(
input_variables=["question","context", "generated_answer"],
template="""
Question: {question}
Context: {context}
Generated Answer: {generated_answer}

Evaluate if the generate answer to the question can be deduced from the context.
Score of 0 or 1, where 1 is perfectly faithful *AND CAN BE DERIVED FROM THE CONTEXT* and 0 otherwise.
you don't mind if the answer is correct, all you care about is if the answer can be deduced from the context.

example:
Question: What are the capitals of France and Spain?
Context: Paris is the capital of France and Madrid is the capital of Spain.
Generated Answer: Paris
in this case the generated answer is faithful to the context so the score should be *1*.

example:
Question: What are the capital cities of France and Spain?
Context: London is the capital of France and Barcelona is the capital of Spain.
Generated Answer: London and Barcelona.
in this case the generated answer is faithful to the context so the score should be *1*.

example:
Question: What are the capital cities of France and Spain?
Context: Paris is the capital of France and Madrid is the capital of Spain.
Generated Answer: Paris.
in this case the generated answer is faithful to the context so the score should be *1*.

exmaple:
Question: What are the capitals of France and Spain?
Context: London is the capital of France and Madrid is the Capital of Spain.
Generated Answer: Paris and Madrid.
in this case the generated answer is based on the pretrained knowledge of the llm and is not faithful to the context so the score should be *0*.

example:
Question: What is the capital of France and Spain?
Context: Monkeys like to eat bananas.
Generated Answer: Paris and Madrid.
in this case the generated answer is not based on the context so the score should be *0*.

example:
Question: What is the capital of France?
Context: Paris.
Generated Answer: Paris.
in this case the context doesn't specify that Paris is the capital of France, and it cannot be deduced from the context, so the score should be *0*.


Example:
Question: What is 2+2?
Context: 4.
Generated Answer: 4.
In this case, the context states '4', but it does not provide information to deduce the answer to 'What is 2+2?', so the score should be *0*.

0.33 - Somewhat relevant: Contains related keywords or concepts
0.66 - Relevant: Partially answers or strongly implies the answer
