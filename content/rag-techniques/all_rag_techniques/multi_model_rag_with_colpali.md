### Overview:
This code implements one of the multiple ways of multi-model RAG. This project processes a PDF file, retrieves relevant content using Colpali, and generates answers using a multi-modal RAG system. The process includes document indexing, querying, and summarizing with the Gemini model.

### Key Components:
- **RAGMultiModalModel**: Used for document indexing and retrieval.
- **PDF Processing**: Downloads and processes "Attention is All You Need" paper.
- **Gemini Model**: Used for content generation from retrieved images and queries.
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**: Manages image data retrieved during search.

### Motivation:
To enable efficient querying and content generation from multi-modal documents (PDFs with text and images) in response to natural language queries.

### Method Details:
- Indexing: The PDF is indexed using the `RAGMultiModalModel`, storing both text and image data.
- Querying: Natural language queries retrieve relevant document segments.
- Image Processing: Images from the document are decoded, displayed, and used in conjunction with the Gemini model to generate content.

### Benefits:
- Multi-modal support for both text and images.
- Streamlined retrieval and summarization pipeline.
- Flexible content generation using advanced LLMs (Gemini model).

### Implementation:
- PDF is indexed, and the content is split into text and image segments.
- A query is run against the indexed document to fetch the relevant results.
- Retrieved image data is decoded and passed through the Gemini model for answer generation.

### Summary:
This project integrates document indexing, retrieval, and content generation in a multi-modal setting, enabling efficient queries on complex documents like research papers.

## Setup


```python
# Install required packages
!pip install pillow python-dotenv
```

```python
!pip install -q git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git qwen-vl-utils flash-attn optimum auto-gptq bitsandbytes
```

# Package Installation and Imports

The cell below installs all necessary packages required to run this notebook.


```python
# Install required packages
!pip install base64 byaldi os ragmultimodalmodel
```

# Package Installation

The cell below installs all necessary packages required to run this notebook. If you're running this notebook in a new environment, execute this cell first to ensure all dependencies are installed.

```python
# Install required packages
!pip install byaldi
```

```python
import base64
import os
os.environ["HF_token"] = 'your-huggingface-api-key' # to download the ColPali model
from byaldi import RAGMultiModalModel
```

```python
RAG = RAGMultiModalModel.from_pretrained("vidore/colpali-v1.2", verbose=1)
```

### Download the "Attention is all you need" paper

```python
!wget https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762
!mkdir docs
!mv 1706.03762 docs/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf
```

### Indexing

```python
RAG.index(
    input_path="./docs/attention_is_all_you_need.pdf",
    index_name="attention_is_all_you_need",
    store_collection_with_index=True, # set this to false if you don't want to store the base64 representation
    overwrite=True
)
```

### Query time

```python
query = "What is the BLEU score of the Transformer (base model)?"
```

```python
results = RAG.search(query, k=1)
```

### Actual image data

```python
image_bytes = base64.b64decode(results[0].base64)
```

```python
filename = 'image.jpg'  # I assume you have a JPG file
with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
  f.write(image_bytes)
```

```python
from IPython.display import Image

display(Image(filename))
```

## Test using gemini-1.5-flash

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key='your-api-key')
model = genai.GenerativeModel(model_name="gemini-1.5-flash")
```

```python
from PIL import Image
image = Image.open(filename)
```

```python
response = model.generate_content([image, query])
print(response.text)
```
