# **EU Green deal compliance FAQ Bot**

A RAG based AI agent that helps SMEs/ businesses quickly find answers to common questions about EU green deal policies. This bot will focus on responding to frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to the most relevant regulations, providing short and clear answers to help businesses understand and meet compliance standards.



**Functionality:** The bot answers basic questions about key EU environmental regulations, focusing on common requirements like waste management, carbon footprint reporting, and renewable energy.



# **Motivation**

Navigating EU green compliance can be overwhelming for businesses, especially smaller ones without dedicated resources. The project aims to simplify this process by creating a smart, accessible FAQ bot that provides instant, accurate answers to common questions about the EU Green Deal, emissions reporting, and waste management. By helping businesses understand and meet green regulations, compliance easier—it will contribute to a more sustainable future for everyone.

# **Method Details**

### **Document Storage and Embedding:**
Large documents are preprocessed into manageable chunks using a LLM for semantic chunking and stored in a vectorstore.
### **Query Processing:**
User queries are first rephrased to improve clarity and intent matching. The rephrased queries are then embedded using the same model. Using vector similarity and semantic relevance, the system retrieves the most relevant document chunks from the FAISS vectorstore.

### **Summarization:**
Context-aware and concise response are generated from the retrieved chunks using an LLM. This summarization step emphasizes clarity and ensures the answer directly aligns with the user’s query, distilling only the most relevant information.
### **Evaluation:**
Generated answers are evaluated against a gold Q&A dataset for factual accuracy and contextual relevance. The evaluation process includes metrics such as cosine similarity, F1 score, and semantic match.
### **Key Agents:**
Retriever Agent:
Retrieves the most semantically relevant chunks from the FAISS vectorstore based on the processed and embedded user query

Summarizer Agent:
Generate a coherent, concise response based on retrieved content.

Evaluation Agent:
Evaluates the quality of the generated response using gold-standard answers and similarity metrics.

# **Benefits of the Approach**


### **Accuracy and Fact-Checking:**
Reduces hallucination by grounding answers in external knowledge.

### **Modularity:**
The system's components (retriever, summarizer, evaluator) are independently - designed, allowing seamless improvements or replacements as needed.

### **Better evaluation:**
Combines advanced metrics like cosine similarity and F1 scores with gold q&a benchmark.

### **Flexibility:**
Adaptable across various domains and use cases with minimal pipeline changes, accommodating tailored retriever and summarizer configurations.

### **Context-Aware Responses:**
Incorporates context from both the query and the retrieved information.
