# Scientific paper agent using LangGraph

## Overview



This project implements an intelligent research assistant that helps users navigate, understand, and analyze scientific literature using LangGraph and advanced language models. By combining various academic API with sophisticated paper processing techniques, it creates a seamless experience for researchers, students, and professionals working with academic papers.

> NOTE: The presented workflow is not domain specific: each step in the graph can be adapted to a different domain by simply changing the prompts.


## Motivation

Research literature review represents a significant time investment in R&D, with studies showing that researchers spend 30-50% of their time reading, analyzing, and synthesizing academic papers. This challenge is universal across the research community. While thorough literature review is crucial for advancing science and technology, the current process remains inefficient and time-consuming.

Key challenges include:
- Extensive time commitment (30-50% of R&D hours) dedicated to reading and processing papers
- Inefficient search processes across fragmented database ecosystems
- Complex task of synthesizing and connecting findings across multiple papers
- Resource-intensive maintenance of comprehensive literature reviews
- Ongoing effort required to stay current with new publications

## Key components

 1. State-Driven Workflow Engine 
    - StateGraph Architecture: Five-node system for orchestrated research 
    - Decision Making Node: Query intent analysis and routing 
    - Planning Node: Research strategy formulation
    - Tool Execution Node: Paper retrieval and processing 
    - Judge Node: Quality validation and improvement cycles 

2. Paper Processing Integration 
    - Source Integration, CORE API for comprehensive paper access 
    - Document Processing, PDF content extraction, Text structure preservation 

3. Analysis Workflow 
    - State-aware processing pipeline 
    - Multi-step validation gates 
    - Quality-focused improvement cycles 
    - Human-in-the-loop validation options

An overview of the workflow is shown below:

## Method details

1. The system requires 
    - OpenAI API key to access GPT 4o. This model was chosen after comparing its performance with other, open-source alternatives (in particular Llama 3). However, any other LLM with tool calling capabilities can be used.
    - CORE API key for paper retrieval. CORE is one of the larges online repositories for scientific papers, counting over 136 million papers, and offers a free API for personal use. A key can be requested [here](https://core.ac.uk/services/api#form).

2. Technical Architecture: 
    - LangGraph for state orchestration.
    - PDFplumber for document processing.
    - Pydantic for structured data handling.

> Acknowledgment: Special thanks to CORE API for enabling academic paper access.

The `agent_prompt` contains a section explaining how to use complex queries with the CORE API, enabling the agent to solve more complex tasks.

```python
# Prompt for the initial decision making on how to reply to the user
decision_making_prompt = """
You are an experienced scientific researcher.
Your goal is to help the user with their scientific research.

Based on the user query, decide if you need to perform a research or if you can answer the question directly.
- You should perform a research if the user query requires any supporting evidence or information.
- You should answer the question directly only for simple conversational questions, like "how are you?".
"""

# Prompt to create a step by step plan to answer the user query

# EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE

## CORE API

The CORE API has a specific query language that allows you to explore a vast papers collection and perform complex queries. See the following table for a list of available operators:

| Operator       | Accepted symbols         | Meaning                                                                                      |
|---------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| And           | AND, +, space          | Logical binary and.                                                                           |
| Or            | OR                     | Logical binary or.                                                                            |
| Grouping      | (...)                  | Used to prioritise and group elements of the query.                                           |
| Field lookup  | field_name:value       | Used to support lookup of specific fields.                                                    |
| Range queries | fieldName(>, <,>=, <=) | For numeric and date fields, it allows to specify a range of valid values to return.         |
| Exists queries| _exists_:fieldName     | Allows for complex queries, it returns all the items where the field specified by fieldName is not empty. |

Use this table to formulate more complex queries filtering for specific papers, for example publication date/year.
Here are the relevant fields of a paper object you can use to filter the results:
{
  "authors": [{"name": "Last Name, First Name"}],
  "documentType": "presentation" or "research" or "thesis",
  "publishedDate": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
  "title": "Title of the paper",
  "yearPublished": "2019"
}

Example queries:
- "machine learning AND yearPublished:2023"
- "maritime biology AND yearPublished>=2023 AND yearPublished<=2024"
- "cancer research AND authors:Vaswani, Ashish AND authors:Bello, Irwan"
- "title:Attention is all you need"
- "mathematics AND _exists_:abstract"
"""

# Prompt for the judging step to evaluate the quality of the final answer
judge_prompt = """
You are an expert scientific researcher.
Your goal is to review the final answer you provided for a specific user query.

Look at the conversation history between you and the user. Based on it, you need to decide if the final answer is satisfactory or not.

A good final answer should:
- Directly answer the user query. For example, it does not answer a question about a different paper or area of research.
- Answer extensively the request from the user.
- Take into account any feedback given through the conversation.
- Provide inline sources to support any claim made in the answer.

In case the answer is not good enough, provide clear and concise feedback on what needs to be improved to pass the evaluation.
"""
```

## Utility classes and functions

This cell contains the utility classes and functions used in the workflow. It includes a wrapper around the CORE API, the Pydantic models for the input and output of the nodes, and a few general-purpose functions.

The `CoreAPIWrapper` class includes a retry mechanism to handle transient errors and make the workflow more robust.


```python

```

## Agent state

This cell defines the agent state, which contains the following information:
- `requires_research`: Whether the user query requires research or not.
- `num_feedback_requests`: The number of times the LLM asked for feedback.
- `is_good_answer`: Whether the LLM's final answer is good or not.
- `messages`: The conversation history between the user and the LLM.

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """The state of the agent during the paper research process."""
    requires_research: bool = False
    num_feedback_requests: int = 0
    is_good_answer: bool = False
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], add_messages]
```

## Agent tools

This cell defines the tools available to the agent. The toolkit contains a tool to search for scientific papers using the CORE API, a tool to download a scientific paper from a given URL, and a tool to ask for human feedback.

To make the paper download more robust, the tool includes a retry mechanism, similar to the one used for the CORE API, as well as a mock browser header to avoid 403 errors.

```python
@tool("search-papers", args_schema=SearchPapersInput)

## Workflow nodes

This cell defines the nodes of the workflow. Note how the `judge_node` is configured to end the execution if the LLM failed to provide a good answer twice to keep latency acceptable.

## Workflow definition

This cell defines the workflow using LangGraph.

```python
# Initialize the StateGraph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes to the graph
workflow.add_node("decision_making", decision_making_node)
workflow.add_node("planning", planning_node)

# Compile the graph
app = workflow.compile()
```

## Example usecase for PhD academic research

This cell tests the workflow with several example queries. These queries are designed to evaluate the agent on the following aspects:
- Completing tasks that are representative of the work a PhD researcher might need to perform.
- Addressing more specific tasks that require researching papers within a defined timeframe.
- Tackling tasks across multiple areas of research.
- Critically evaluating its own responses by sourcing specific information from the papers.

```python
test_inputs = [
    "Download and summarize the findings of this paper: https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11379842/pdf/11671_2024_Article_4070.pdf",

    "Can you find 8 papers on quantum machine learning?",

    """Find recent papers (2023-2024) about CRISPR applications in treating genetic disorders, 
    focusing on clinical trials and safety protocols""",

    """Find and analyze papers from 2023-2024 about the application of transformer architectures in protein folding prediction, 
    specifically looking for novel architectural modifications with experimental validation."""
]

# Run tests and store the results for later visualisation
outputs = []
for test_input in test_inputs:
    final_answer = await print_stream(app, test_input)
    outputs.append(final_answer.content)
```

# Display results

This cell displays the results of the test queries for a more compact visualisation of the results.


```python
for input, output in zip(test_inputs, outputs):
    display(Markdown(f"## Input:\n\n{input}\n\n"))
    display(Markdown(f"## Output:\n\n{output}\n\n"))
```

## Comparative Analysis

In this comprehensive analysis, we evaluated our Scientific Paper Agent against two leading AI knowledge co pilots : Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity AI. Using a standardized query - "Find 8 papers on quantum machine learning" - we conducted a detailed comparison across multiple dimensions to understand the strengths, limitations, and optimal use cases for each system.


#### Test Case Implementation

We implemented a controlled test using the same research query across all three platforms:
- Query: "Find 8 papers on quantum machine learning"
- Sample Size: Multiple test runs to ensure consistency
- Evaluation Time: Early 2024
- Metrics Tracked: Response time, metadata quality, and result structure

#### Key Findings

While our agent demonstrated superior academic rigor and metadata completeness, taking approximately 30 seconds per query, competitors like Microsoft Copilot (2 seconds) and Perplexity AI (4-5 seconds) showed advantages in response speed. This tradeoff between speed and depth reflects different design philosophies and target use cases.

The comparative analysis reveals a clear differentiation in approaches:
- Our Agent: Optimized for thorough academic research with comprehensive validation
- Microsoft Copilot: Focused on rapid information retrieval and general overview
- Perplexity AI: Balanced approach with emphasis on source verification

![image](https://i.ibb.co/5KbTmFq/Screenshot-2024-11-17-at-22-03-43.png)


Here we present a comprehensive comparison between our research assistant agent and leading platforms (Microsoft Copilot and Perplexity AI). Using a standardized query - "Find 8 papers on quantum machine learning" - we evaluated performance across key metrics including response time, metadata quality, and academic value. Our analysis reveals distinct trade-offs: while our agent takes longer to process (30s vs. 2-5s), it provides significantly more detailed metadata, validated sources, and structured academic output. The comparison table above breaks down these differences across multiple dimensions, helping users choose the right tool for their specific research needs - whether it's quick exploration (where Copilot excels) or deep academic research (where our agent shows its strengths).
