# E2E Testing Agent

## Overview
This notebook defines an intelligent agent designed to control a headless browser and perform end-to-end (E2E) testing on web pages. 
Users can specify the webpage URL and describe test cases in natural language. 
The agent will interpret these instructions, generate, and execute the tests.

## Motivation
Programmatic browser control and E2E testing were traditionally done by writing scripts in frameworks such as Puppeteer or Playwright. We want to use the Agent system to allow the user to specify the E2E test cases in natural language. The agent will then create and execute these tests through Playwright.

## Key Components
1. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) - agent implementation
2. [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) - a Python Playwright version that we can use to generate a script that can execute the test
3. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) - A web framework that servers static HTML web page with a registration form
4. [langchain_community.agent_toolkits.PlayWrightBrowserToolkit](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/integrations/toolkits/playwright/)

## Method
The E2E tests generation process goes through the following steps:

1. **Instructions To Actions Conversion**: Convert user instruction for testing into well defined action steps that will be implemented.

2. **Playwright Code Generation**: Generate Playwright code chunks that execute specified action steps.

3. **Assertions Generation**: Creates assertions that specify whether the test have passed or not.

4. **Test Execution**: Evaluates the generate Playwright test case.

5. **Report Generation**: Creates the concise report of 


## Conclusion
The implemented agent generates and evaluates Playwright tests based on user instructions, dynamically adapting to changes in the webpage DOM. It executes the tests and provides a concise report. Making the E2E testing process more accessible.

## Setup and Imports

#### **WINDOWS ISSUE!**
**Note: To run Playwright in Jupyter on Windows you need to follow this issue https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/issues/178#issuecomment-1302869947**

Install the required libraries.

```python
%pip install langchain==0.2.16 langchain-community==0.2.16 langchain-core==0.2.38 langchain-experimental==0.0.65 langchain-openai==0.1.23 langchain-text-splitters==0.2.4 langgraph==0.2.18 langgraph-checkpoint==1.0.9 python-dotenv==1.0.1 openai==1.43.0 Flask==3.0.3 pytest-playwright==0.5.2 ipytest==0.14.2 nest-asyncio==1.6.0
```

Import necessary libraries and set up the environment.

```python
import os
import re
import ast
import io

from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Sequence, List
from langgraph.graph import Graph, END
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.prompts.chat import SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate
from langchain.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables.graph import MermaidDrawMethod
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
import ipytest

# These imports are unecessary for the playwrigt script execution
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright
import asyncio
import nest_asyncio


from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

from IPython.display import display, Image
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()
```

Initialize the LLM instance. You can instantiate a LLM of your choice.

```python
llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
    model_name=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_LLM_MODEL"),
    deployment_name=os.getenv("AZURE_OPENAI_LLM_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT"),
    temperature=0.0,
    streaming=True,
)
```

## Define Data Structures

Define the structure for the graph state using TypedDict.

```python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[HumanMessage | AIMessage], "The messages in the conversation"]
    query: Annotated[str, "A user query containing instructions for the creation of the test case"]
    actions: Annotated[List[str], "List of actions for which to generate the code."]
    target_url: Annotated[str, "Valid URL of the website to test."]
    current_action: Annotated[int, "The index of the current action to generate the code for."]
    current_action_code: Annotated[int, "Code for the current action."]
    aggregated_raw_actions: Annotated[str, "Raw aggregation of the actions"]
    script: Annotated[str, "The generated Playwright script."]
    website_state: Annotated[str, "DOM state of the website."]
    error_message: Annotated[str, "Message that occurred during the processing of the action."]
    test_evaluation_output: Annotated[str, "Evaluation of the final test script."]
    test_name: Annotated[str, "Name of the generated test."]

class ActionList(BaseModel):
    actions: List[str] = Field(..., description="List of atomic actions for end-to-end testing")
```

## Define Graph Functions

Define the functions that will be used in the LangGraph workflow.

Define function translates natural language test instructions into a structured list of atomic actions using a LLM and a predefined schema. It generates JSON-formatted action steps for end-to-end testing.

```python
async def convert_user_instruction_to_actions(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    "Parse user instructions into a list of actions to be executed."

    output_parser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=ActionList)

    chat_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
        [
            SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
                """
                You are an end-to-end testing specialist.
                Your goal is to break down general business end-to-end testing tasks into smaller well-defined actions.
                These actions will be later used to write the actual code that will execute the tests.
                """
            ),
            HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(
                """
                Convert the following <Input> into a JSON dictionary with the key "actions" and a list of atomic steps as its value.
                These steps will later be used to generate end-to-end test scripts.
                Each action should be a clear, atomic step that can be translated into code.
                Aim to generate the minimum number of actions needed to accomplish what the user intends to test.
                The first action must always be navigating to the target URL.
                The last action should always be asserting the expected outcome of the test.
                Do not add any extra characters, comments, or explanations outside of this JSON structure. Only output the JSON result.

                Examples:
                Input: "Test the login flow of the website"
                Output: {{
                    "actions": [
                        "Navigate to the login page via the URL.",

                        "Enter a valid password in the 'Password' input field",
                        "Click the 'Login' button to submit credentials",
                        "Verify that the user is logged in by expecting that the correct user name appears in the website header."
                    ]
                }}

                Input: "Test adding item to the shopping cart."
                Output: {{
                    "actions": [
                        "Navigate to the product listing page via the URL.",
                        "Click on the first product in the listing to open product details",
                        "Click the 'Add to Cart' button to add the selected item",
                        "Expect the selected item name appears in the shopping cart sidebar or page"
                    ]
                }}

                <Inptut>: {query}
                <Output>:

            ),
        ]
    )

    chain = chat_template | llm | output_parser

    actions_structure = chain.invoke({"query": state["query"]})

    return {**state, "actions": actions_structure.actions}
```

Defines function to initialize a Playwright script with navigation to the target URL as the first action. It increases the action counter and provides initial script with desired format.

```python
# Note: to run Playwright in Jupyter on Windows you need to follow this issue https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/issues/178#issuecomment-1302869947

Defines function to execute the current Playwright script and retrieve the webpage's document object model (DOM) state. This DOM state is later used for generating code for the current action.

```python
async def get_website_state(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    """Get the current DOM of the website."""

    }
```

Defines function to generate Python Playwright code for a specified testing action using an LLM. It incorporates the website's DOM, previous actions, and action details to produce atomic, executable code. The generated code is later validated and added to the script.

## Set Up LangGraph Workflow

Define graph with nodes.

```python
workflow = Graph()

workflow.add_node("convert_user_instruction_to_actions", convert_user_instruction_to_actions)
workflow.add_node("get_initial_action", get_initial_action)
workflow.add_node("get_website_state", get_website_state)
workflow.add_node("generate_code_for_action", generate_code_for_action)
workflow.add_node("validate_generated_action", validate_generated_action)
workflow.add_node("handle_generation_error", handle_generation_error)
workflow.add_node("post_process_script", post_process_script)
workflow.add_node("execute_test_case", execute_test_case)
workflow.add_node("generate_test_report", generate_test_report)
```

Add edges to the graph.

```python
workflow.set_entry_point("convert_user_instruction_to_actions")

workflow.add_edge("convert_user_instruction_to_actions", "get_initial_action")
workflow.add_edge("get_initial_action", "get_website_state")
workflow.add_edge("get_website_state", "generate_code_for_action")
workflow.add_edge("generate_code_for_action", "validate_generated_action")

workflow.add_conditional_edges("validate_generated_action", decide_next_path, ['get_website_state', 'handle_generation_error', "post_process_script"])

workflow.add_edge('handle_generation_error', END)
workflow.add_edge("post_process_script", "execute_test_case")

workflow.add_edge("execute_test_case", "generate_test_report")
workflow.add_edge("generate_test_report", END)

app = workflow.compile()
```

## Display Graph Structure

This cell creates a visual representation of the E2E agent workflow.

```python
display(
    Image(
        app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(
            draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API,
        )
    )
)
```

## Define Workflow Function

Define a function to run the workflow and display results.

```python
async def run_workflow(query: str, target_url: str):
    """Run the LangGraph workflow"""
    initial_state = {
        'messages': [],
        'query': query,
        'actions': [],
        'target_url': target_url,
        'current_action': 0,
        'current_action_code': "",
        'aggregated_raw_actions': "",
        'script': None,
        'website_state': None,
        'error_message': None,
        'test_name': None,
        
    }

    result = await app.ainvoke(initial_state)

    return result
```

## Execute Workflow

Start up a mockup web page as a subprocess (does not block notebook execution) to evaluate the workflow.

```python
import subprocess

process = subprocess.Popen(
    ["flask", "run",],
    env={"FLASK_APP": "../data/e2e_testing_agent_app.py", "FLASK_ENV": "development", **os.environ}
)
```

Run the workflow with a sample query.

```python
query = "Test a registration form that contains username, password and password confirmation fields. After submitting it, verify that registration was successful."
target_url = "http://localhost:5000"
result = await run_workflow(query, target_url)
```

Terminate the Flask subprocess.

```python
process.kill() 
print("Flask app terminated.")
```

## Display Testing Report

Display the report from the execution of the generated tests.

```python
print(result["report"])
```
