# Project Manager Assistant Agent

## Overview
This tutorial demonstrates how to create a an AI agent that assists in project management tasks including creating actionable tasks from a given project description, identify the dependency within the tasks, create a task execution schedule for the project, and assign the individual tasks to project members based on their expertise and experience. This application uses a combination of custom functions, structured output, and an agent that can streamline the project management, in particular during the project initation / setup process. 


## Motivation
Effective management is key to project success. It already starts, with the setup of the project, definition of tasks, scheduling and allocation of team members. However, with increasing complexity of the project, this task becomes more and more challenging and time consuming frequently requiring days of planning involving several members of the organization.

The ```Project Manager Assistant Agent``` was created to transfrom how projects are initiated by introducing automation, intelligence, and precision into the process. It enables project managers to seamless translate project description into structure, actionable plans, mapping dependencies for better workflow alignment and assign tasks based on team members' expertise and experience. In addition, it creates risks scores for the individual tasks allowing overall project risk assessment. This overall project risk score is used as part of a self-reflection (along insights generations on the actual plan) to further improve the schedule and task assignment to reduce the project risks. (see details on the implementation).

### Benefits
This AI-driven approach reduces the burden of manual planning and eliminates redundancies, allowing project managers to shift their focus to higher-level strategy and decision. making.

## Implementation
In the following section, we provide a detailed overview how to implement the Project Manager Assistant Agent.

### Install and import tutorial specific libraries

```python
!pip install langchain langgraph langchain-openai pandas plotly networkx pyvis openai python-dotenv -q
```

```python
import os
import uuid
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import List, TypedDict
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAI, ChatOpenAI
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START,END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from IPython.display import Image, display, Markdown, HTML
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv(override=True)

# Define your model provider
model_provider = 'Azure' # 'Azure' or 'OpenAI'
```

### Instantiate LLM model

```python
# Based on model_provider load the language model
if model_provider == 'Azure':
    """
    Define your environmental variables under .venv:
        - AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY    
        - OPENAI_API_VERSION
        - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
    """
    llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
        deployment_name='gpt-4o-mini',  # Your actual deployment name
    )
elif model_provider == 'OpenAI':
    """
    Define your environmental variables under .venv:
        - OPENAI_API_KEY
        - OPENAI_API_BASE
    """
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
else:
    print('Implement your own llm loader')
```

```python
# Test your LLM
llm.invoke("Hello, how are you?")
```

In the following section, we will step-by-step implement:
- The data classes,
- Agent state,
- Nodes and function (used as a router),
- and the workflow of the agent.

So let's create all required data classes first:

```python
# Data Models
class Task(BaseModel):
    id: uuid.UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid.uuid4, description="Unique identifier for the task")
    task_name: str = Field(description="Name of the task")
    task_description: str = Field(description="Description of the task")
    estimated_day: int = Field(description="Estimated number of days to complete the task")

class TaskList(BaseModel):
    tasks: List[Task] = Field(description="List of tasks")

class TaskDependency(BaseModel):
    """Task dependency model"""
    task: Task = Field(description="Task")
    dependent_tasks: List[Task] = Field(description="List of dependent tasks")

class TeamMember(BaseModel):
    name: str = Field(description="Name of the team member")
    profile: str = Field(description="Profile of the team member")

class Team(BaseModel):
    team_members: List[TeamMember] = Field(description="List of team members")

# Iterative assessment
class TaskAllocation(BaseModel):
    """Task allocation class"""
    task: Task = Field(description="Task")
    team_member: TeamMember = Field(description="Team members assigned to the task")

class TaskSchedule(BaseModel):
    """Schedule schedule class"""
    task: Task = Field(description="Task")
    start_day: int = Field(description="Start day of the task")
    end_day: int = Field(description="End day of the task")

# Lists
class DependencyList(BaseModel):
    """List of task dependencies"""
    dependencies: List[TaskDependency] = Field(description="List of task dependencies")

class Schedule(BaseModel):
    """List of task schedules"""
    schedule: List[TaskSchedule] = Field(description="List of task schedules")

class TaskAllocationList(BaseModel):
    """List of task allocations"""
    task_allocations: List[TaskAllocation] = Field(description="List of task allocations")

# Iteration
class TaskAllocationListIteration(BaseModel):
    """List of task allocations for each iteration"""
    task_allocations_iteration: List[TaskAllocationList] = Field(description="List of task allocations for each iteration")

class ScheduleIteration(BaseModel):
    """List of task schedules for each iteration"""
    schedule: List[Schedule] = Field(description="List of task schedules for each iteration")

class Risk(BaseModel):
    """Risk of a task"""
    task: Task = Field(description="Task")
    score: str = Field(description="Risk associated with the task")

class RiskList(BaseModel):
    """List of risks for each iteration"""
    risks: List[Risk] = Field(description="List of risks")

class RiskListIteration(BaseModel):
    """List of risks for each iteration"""
    risks_iteration: List[RiskList] = Field(description="List of risks for each iteration")
```

In the next step, let's create the AgentState. The `schedule_iteration`, `task_allocations_iteration`, `risks_iteration` are introduced to generate structured 'memory' for the self-reflection cycles.

```python
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    """The project manager agent state."""
    project_description: str
    team: Team
    tasks: TaskList
    dependencies: DependencyList
    schedule: Schedule
    task_allocations: TaskAllocationList
    risks: RiskList
    iteration_number: int
    max_iteration: int
    insights: List[str]
    schedule_iteration: List[Schedule]
    task_allocations_iteration: List[TaskAllocationList]
    risks_iteration: List[RiskListIteration]
    project_risk_score_iterations: List[int]
```

Well done, let's create the required nodes. As a quick recap:

 In LangGraph a node is defined as a function which has an argument the `AgentState`. Within the node certain attributes of the field state is updated which at the end of the node is returned to the workflow manager and passed to the next node. Inside the nodes, LLM's are used to generate (non)-structured response.

In this tutorial we have implemented the nodes based on th following pattern:

```
def task_generation_node(state: AgentState):
 """LangGraph node that will extract tasks from given project description"""
    description = state["project_description"]
    prompt = f"""You are an experienced project description analyzer. Analyze the 
    project description '{description}' and create a list of actionable and
    realistic tasks with estimated time (in days) to complete each task.
    If the task takes longer than 5 days, break it down into independent smaller tasks.
    """
    structure_llm = llm.with_structured_output(TaskList)
    tasks: TaskList = structure_llm.invoke(prompt)
    state['tasks'] = tasks
    return state
```
In almost all nodes, we used:
- `llm.with_structured_output(<structure>)` - generating structured output. 

The .with_structured_output() method enables models with native APIs for structured outputs, such as function calling or JSON mode, to reliably produce outputs as objects based on a defined schema. The schema can be specified using a TypedDict, JSON Schema, or a Pydantic class, determining whether the output is a dictionary or a Pydantic object.

The only exception is the insight_generation_node where only `str` as requested from the llm and the required interface only `llm.invoke(prompt)`

```python
# Workflow Nodes
def task_generation_node(state: AgentState):
    """LangGraph node that will extract tasks from given project description"""
    description = state["project_description"]
    prompt = f"""

The proposed agentic workflow contains a conditional routing in which the logic was built around the overall risk score of the project plan. The task scheduling and task assignment is carried out at least twice in a 'self-reflection' in order to minimize the overall project risk assigned in each iteration as part of the `risk_assessment_node`. If the risk was reduced the agent finishes its task, otherwise tries to self-reflect using an `insight_generation_node` from which the insights fed back to the scheduler_node.

```python
def router(state: AgentState):
    """LangGraph node that will route the agent to the appropriate node based on the project description"""
    max_iteration = state["max_iteration"]
    iteration_number = state["iteration_number"]

    if iteration_number < max_iteration:
        if len(state["project_risk_score_iterations"])>1:
            if state["project_risk_score_iterations"][-1] < state["project_risk_score_iterations"][0]:
                return END
            else:
                return "insight_generator"
        else:
            return "insight_generator"
    else:
        return END
```

As a last remainign step, let's create an agentic workflow using LangGraph.

```python
# Instantiate the workflow    
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)

# Add nodes to the workflow
workflow.add_node("task_generation", task_generation_node)
workflow.add_node("task_dependencies", task_dependency_node)
workflow.add_node("task_scheduler", task_scheduler_node)

## Usage Example

#### Initiate of the AgentState by defining an input
Our Project Manager Agent requires a project description (str) and a team (Team) input next to other initialization parameters.
In this tutorial we provide two dummy input under `data`. The team is defined as a csv file, composed of 2 colums: <i>Name</i>,<i>Profile Description</i>

```python
def get_project_description(file_path:str):
    """Read the project description from the file"""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            content = file.read()

    return content

def get_team(file_path:str):
    """Read the team members from the CSV file"""
    team_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    team_members = [
            TeamMember(name=row['Name'], profile=row['Profile Description'])
            for _, row in team_df.iterrows()
        ]
    team = Team(team_members=team_members)

    return team

project_description = get_project_description("../data/project_manager_assistant/project_description.txt")
team = get_team("../data/project_manager_assistant/team.csv")

print(project_description)
print(team)
```

```python
# Definition of the AgentState 
state_input = {
    "project_description": project_description,
    "team": team,
    "insights": "",
    "iteration_number": 0,
    "max_iteration": 3,
    "schedule_iteration": [],
    "task_allocations_iteration": [],
    "risks_iteration": [],
    "project_risk_score_iterations": []
}
```

```python
# Invoke the agent
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
for event in graph_plan.stream(state_input, config, stream_mode=["updates"]):
    "Print the different nodes as the agent progresses"
    print(f"Current node: {next(iter(event[1]))}")

```

```python
# Retrive the final state
final_state = graph_plan.get_state(config).values
print(final_state['iteration_number'])
print(final_state['project_risk_score_iterations'])
```

As we can see from the final_state the agentic workflow ended up having at least 2 iterations, and under `project_risk_score_iterations` we may see evolution of the project risk score. Even if the overall risk score does not descrease between iterations (additional prompt engineering can potentially improve it), we can assume that by increasing the project timeline (e.g., iteration #2) - the risk should descrease.

#### Visualize the results
To better understand the output of the agentic workflow - here we provide visualizations for:
- Project plan - Gantt-char for all created scenarios

```python
# Visalize Project timeline
number_of_iterations = final_state['iteration_number']

for i in range(number_of_iterations):
    ## Tasks schedule
    task_schedules = final_state['schedule_iteration'][i].schedule

    t = []
    # Iterate over the task_schedules and append each task's data to the DataFrame
    for task_schedule in task_schedules:
        t.append([
            task_schedule.task.task_name,
            task_schedule.start_day,
            task_schedule.end_day
        ])

    df_schedule = pd.DataFrame(t,columns=['task_name', 'start', 'end'])

    ## Tasks allocation
    task_allocations = final_state['task_allocations_iteration'][i].task_allocations

    t = []
    # Iterate over the task_schedules and append each task's data to the DataFrame
    for task_allocation in task_allocations:
        t.append([
            task_allocation.task.task_name,
            task_allocation.team_member.name
        ])

    df_allocation = pd.DataFrame(t,columns=['task_name', 'team_member'])

    df = df_allocation.merge(df_schedule, on='task_name')

    import plotly.express as px

    from datetime import datetime, timedelta
    # Get the current date
    current_date = datetime.today()

    # Convert start and end offsets to actual dates
    df['start'] = df['start'].apply(lambda x: current_date + timedelta(days=x))
    df['end'] = df['end'].apply(lambda x: current_date + timedelta(days=x))

    df.rename(columns={'team_member': 'Team Member'}, inplace=True)
    df.sort_values(by='Team Member', inplace=True)
    # Create a Gantt chart
    fig = px.timeline(df, x_start="start", x_end="end", y="task_name", color="Team Member", title=f"Gantt Chart - Iteration:{i+1} ")

    # Update layout for better visualization
    fig.update_layout(
        xaxis_title="Timeline",
        yaxis_title="Tasks",
        yaxis=dict(autorange="reversed"),  # Reverse the y-axis to have tasks in the vertical side
        title_x=0.5
    )

    # Show the plot
    fig.show()
```

## Comparison

As a comparison, we have implemented a simple agent composed of only 1 node aiming create a project plan as a 1-short.
The input remained the `project_description` and the `team`. The prompt became the combination of the each node - except the risk and insight generations.
The single node agent with the simplied stage could create a project plan.

However, the expected complex structured response may not always be achieved by the LLM, resulting in error at downstream processing steps. In addition, a multi-agent solution allows for incorporation of self-reflection at different stages of the planning (in the future even human-in-the-loop) even including new information via user interactions (e.g. sickness , holidays of people team members).

    project_description: str
    team: Team
    tasks: TaskList
    dependencies: DependencyList
    schedule: Schedule
    task_allocations: TaskAllocationList

def project_plan_generation_node(state: SimpleAgentState):
    """LangGraph node that will extract tasks from given project description"""
    description = state["project_description"]
    team = state["team"]
    prompt = f"""You are an experienced project description analyzer, who needs to create a project plan.
        Create the project plan using the following steps:
        - Analyze the project description '{description}' and create a list of actionable and realistic tasks with estimated time (in days) to complete each task. If the task takes longer than 5 days, break it down into independent smaller tasks.
        - Assess dependency between tasks. For each task, identify the blocking tasks. Provide for each task the list of dependent tasks.
        - Schedule tasks based on the dependencies.
        - Allocate tasks to team members {team} based on their skills and availability, such that there is no overlapping task assigned for a team member. Ensure that no team member has 2 tasks assigned for the same time period.

## Additional Considerations

Improvement Possibilities:
- Incorporating a 'human-in-the-loop' mechanism as part of the self-reflection process can significantly enhance the system's effectiveness. This approach allows for the introduction of additional, real-time information about the schedule and the availability or status of team members. For instance, if a team member is currently sick, the agent would typically still assign tasks to them due to a lack of awareness. By integrating human oversight, such critical updates can be communicated to the system, ensuring that tasks are reassigned appropriately and the workload is distributed more efficiently.
Limitations of the Approach:
- Incorporating an optimizer based on extracted features generated by the LLM can provide better and more reproducible scheduling and task allocation. So only leveraging the agent to produce structured content from the project description, task dependencies and team member profiles, then use the optimizer to create the project plan (task assignment). 

Limitations:
- The current approach relies on a Large Language Model (LLM) to assign risk scores to tasks. However, this method has inherent limitations. Even if the same person is assigned to the same task on the same schedule, the LLM may generate different risk scores each time. This inconsistency arises because the model's output can vary independently of the explicit details provided in the prompt. Consequently, this variability can lead to unpredictable risk assessments, potentially affecting the reliability and accuracy of task management.
- Although the prompts instructs to fullfill certain criteria, it is not always guaranteed, that it will achieve it.
