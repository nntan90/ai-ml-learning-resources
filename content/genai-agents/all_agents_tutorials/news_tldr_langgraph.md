# News TL;DR using Langgraph (Too Long Didn't Read)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a news summarization agent uses large language models (LLMs) for decision making and summarization as well as a news API calls. The integration of LangGraph to coordinate sequential and cyclical processes, open-ai to choose and condense articles, newsAPI to retrieve relevant article metadata, and BeautifulSoup for web scraping allows for the generation of relevant current event article TL;DRs from a single query.

## Motivation
Although LLMs demonstrate excellent conversational and educational ability, they lack access to knowledge of current events. This project allow users to ask about a news topic they are interested and receive a TL;DR of relevant articles. The goal is to allow users to conveniently follow their interest and stay current with their connection to world events.

## Key Components
1. **LangGraph**: Orchestrates the overall workflow, managing the flow of data between different stages of the process.
2. **GPT-4o-mini (via LangChain)**: Generates search terms, selects relevant articles, parses html, provides article summaries
3. **NewsAPI**: Retrieves article metadata from keyword search
4. **BeautifulSoup**: Retrieves html from page
5. **Asyncio**: Allows separate LLM calls to be made concurrently for speed efficiency.

## Method
The news research follows these high-level steps:

1. **NewsAPI Parameter Creation (LLM 1)**: Given a user query, the model generates a formatted parameter dict for the news search.

2. **Article Metadata Retrieval**: An API call to NewsAPI retrieves relevant article metadata.

3. **Article Text Retrieval**: Beautiful Soup scrapes the full article text from the urls to ensure validity.

4. **Conditional Logic**: Conditional logic either: repeats 1-3 if article threshold not reached, proceeds to step 5, end with no articles found.

5. **Relevant Article Selection (LLM 2)**: The model selects urls from the most relevant n-articles for the user query based on the short synopsis provided by the API.

6. **Generate TL;DR (LLM 3+)**: A summarized set of bullet points for each article is generated concurrently with Asyncio.

This workflow is managed by LangGraph to make sure that the appropriate prompt is fed to the each LLM call.

## Conclusion
This news TL;DR agent highlights the utility of coordinating successive LLM generations in order to
achieve a higher level goal.

Although the current implementation only retrieves bulleted summaries, it could be elaborated to start
a dialogue with the user that could allow them to ask questions about the article and get 
more information or to collectively generate a coherent opinion.

## Setup and Imports

Install and import necessary libraries

```python
!pip install langgraph -q
!pip install langchain-openai -q
!pip install langchain-core -q
!pip install pydantic -q
!pip install python-dotenv -q
!pip install newsapi-python -q
!pip install beautifulsoup4 -q
!pip install ipython -q
!pip install nest_asyncio -q
```

```python
import os
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, List
from langgraph.graph import Graph, END
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from langchain_core.output_parsers import JsonOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables.graph import MermaidDrawMethod
from datetime import datetime
import re

from getpass import getpass
from dotenv import load_dotenv

from newsapi import NewsApiClient
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

from IPython.display import display, Image as IPImage
import asyncio
```

## Get an NewsAPI Key
* create a free developer account at https://newsapi.org/
* 100 requests per day
* articles between 1 day and 1 month old

## Setup LLM Model
* create an account and register a credit card at https://platform.openai.com/chat-completions
* create an API key

## Create Your Environmental Variables (Optional)
Create a file named `.env` in the same directory as this notebook with the following
```
OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-api-key'
NEWSAPI_KEY = 'your-api-key'
```

If you skip this step, you will be asked to input all API keys once each time you start this notebook.

## Initialize Model and Environmental Variables

If you're not running a local model with Ollama, the next cell will ask for your OPENAI_API_KEY and
securely add it as an environmental variable. It will not persist in this notebook.

```python
# check for .env file
if os.path.exists("../.env"):
    load_dotenv()
else:
    # ask for API keys
    os.environ["NEWSAPI_KEY"] = getpass("Enter your News API key: ")
    os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass("Enter your OpenAI API key: ")

# sets the OpenAI model to use and initialize model
model = "gpt-4o-mini"
llm = ChatOpenAI(model=model,)
```

```python
newsapi_key = os.getenv("NEWSAPI_KEY")
if newsapi_key:
        print("NEWSAPI_KEY successfully loaded from .env.")
```

## Test APIs

```python
llm.invoke("Why is the sky blue?").content
```

```python
newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key=os.getenv('NEWSAPI_KEY'))

query = 'ai news of the day'

all_articles = newsapi.get_everything(q=query,
                                      sources='google-news,bbc-news,techcrunch',
                                      domains='techcrunch.com, bbc.co.uk',
                                      language='en',
                                      sort_by='relevancy',)


all_articles['articles'][0]
```

## Define Data Structures

Define the GraphState class. Each user query will be added to a new instance of this class, which will be passed
through the LangGraph structure while collect outputs from each step. When it reaches the END node, it's final
result will be returned to the user.

```python
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    news_query: Annotated[str, "Input query to extract news search parameters from."]
    num_searches_remaining: Annotated[int, "Number of articles to search for."]
    newsapi_params: Annotated[dict, "Structured argument for the News API."]
    past_searches: Annotated[List[dict], "List of search params already used."]
    articles_metadata: Annotated[list[dict], "Article metadata response from the News API"]
    scraped_urls: Annotated[List[str], "List of urls already scraped."]
    num_articles_tldr: Annotated[int, "Number of articles to create TL;DR for."]
    potential_articles: Annotated[List[dict[str, str, str]], "Article with full text to consider summarizing."]
    tldr_articles: Annotated[List[dict[str, str, str]], "Selected article TL;DRs."]
    formatted_results: Annotated[str, "Formatted results to display."]
```

## Define NewsAPI argument data structure with Pydantic
* the model will create a formatted dictionary of params for the NewsAPI call
* the NewsApiParams class inherits from the Pydantic BaseModel
* Langchain will parse and feed paramd descriptions to the LLM

```python
class NewsApiParams(BaseModel):
    q: str = Field(description="1-3 concise keyword search terms that are not too specific")
    sources: str =Field(description="comma-separated list of sources from: 'abc-news,abc-news-au,associated-press,australian-financial-review,axios,bbc-news,bbc-sport,bloomberg,business-insider,cbc-news,cbs-news,cnn,financial-post,fortune'")
    from_param: str = Field(description="date in format 'YYYY-MM-DD' Two days ago minimum. Extend up to 30 days on second and subsequent requests.")
    to: str = Field(description="date in format 'YYYY-MM-DD' today's date unless specified")
    language: str = Field(description="language of articles 'en' unless specified one of ['ar', 'de', 'en', 'es', 'fr', 'he', 'it', 'nl', 'no', 'pt', 'ru', 'se', 'ud', 'zh']")
    sort_by: str = Field(description="sort by 'relevancy', 'popularity', or 'publishedAt'")
```

## Define Graph Functions

Define the functions (nodes) that will be used in the LangGraph workflow.

```python

## Set Up LangGraph Workflow

Set up decision logic to try to retrieve `num_searches_remaining` articles, while limiting attempts to 5.

```python
def articles_text_decision(state: GraphState) -> str:
    """Check results of retrieve_articles_text to determine next step."""
    if state["num_searches_remaining"] == 0:
        # if no articles with text were found return END
        if len(state["potential_articles"]) == 0:
            state["formatted_results"] = "No articles with text found."
            return "END"
        # if some articles were found, move on to selecting the top urls
        else:
            return "select_top_urls"
    else:
        # if the number of articles found is less than the number of articles to summarize, continue searching
        if len(state["potential_articles"]) < state["num_articles_tldr"]:
            return "generate_newsapi_params"
        # otherwise move on to selecting the top urls
        else:
            return "select_top_urls"
        
```

Define the LangGraph workflow by adding nodes and edges.

```python
workflow = Graph()

workflow.set_entry_point("generate_newsapi_params")

workflow.add_node("generate_newsapi_params", generate_newsapi_params)
workflow.add_node("retrieve_articles_metadata", retrieve_articles_metadata)
workflow.add_node("retrieve_articles_text", retrieve_articles_text)
workflow.add_node("select_top_urls", select_top_urls)
workflow.add_node("summarize_articles_parallel", summarize_articles_parallel)
workflow.add_node("format_results", format_results)
# workflow.add_node("add_commentary", add_commentary)

workflow.add_edge("generate_newsapi_params", "retrieve_articles_metadata")
workflow.add_edge("retrieve_articles_metadata", "retrieve_articles_text")
# # if the number of articles with parseable text is less than number requested, then search for more articles
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "retrieve_articles_text",
    articles_text_decision,
    {
        "generate_newsapi_params": "generate_newsapi_params",
        "select_top_urls": "select_top_urls",
        "END": END
    }
    )
workflow.add_edge("select_top_urls", "summarize_articles_parallel")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "summarize_articles_parallel",
    lambda state: "format_results" if len(state["tldr_articles"]) > 0 else "END",
    {
        "format_results": "format_results",
        "END": END
    }
    )
workflow.add_edge("format_results", END)

app = workflow.compile()

```

## Display Graph Structure

```python
display(
    IPImage(
        app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(
            draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API,
        )
    )
)
```

## Run Workflow Function

Define a function to run the workflow and display results.

```python
async def run_workflow(query: str, num_searches_remaining: int = 10, num_articles_tldr: int = 3):
    """Run the LangGraph workflow and display results."""
    initial_state = {
        "news_query": query,
        "num_searches_remaining": num_searches_remaining,
        "newsapi_params": {},
        "past_searches": [],
        "articles_metadata": [],
        "scraped_urls": [],
        "num_articles_tldr": num_articles_tldr,
        "potential_articles": [],
        "tldr_articles": [],
        "formatted_results": "No articles with text found."
    }
    try:
        result = await app.ainvoke(initial_state)
        
        return result["formatted_results"]
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
        return None
    
```

## Execute Workflow

Run the workflow with a sample query.

```python
query = "what are the top genai news of today?"
print(await run_workflow(query, num_articles_tldr=3))
```
