# Smart Product Buyer AI Agent

## Overview

This notebook details the **Smart Product Buyer AI Agent**, developed as a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** to assist users in making informed buying decisions. While the current implementation focuses on car purchasing, it is designed to be **easily extendable** to support additional websites and even other product categories. The project leverages **LangGraph** and **LLM-based intelligence** to provide an interactive, efficient, and adaptable user experience.

## Detailed Explanation

### Motivation
Modern consumers face challenges navigating the vast array of product options online. This agent streamlines the search and decision-making process by:
- Understanding user needs and preferences.
- Refining and applying complex filters across multiple platforms. For now, it only supports AutoTrader, but it can be extended to other platforms easily by adding a new scraper in the `scrapers` folder.
- Providing actionable insights and recommendations.

### Key Components
1. **User Input Processing**: Understands user requirements and preferences dynamically using LLM-powered interactions.
2. **Filter Refinement**: Tailors search filters to match user-defined parameters.
3. **Web Scraping and Integration**: Interfaces with platforms like AutoTrader to fetch and present relevant listings.
4. **Summarization and Insights**: Provides concise summaries and insights into listings, including general market reliability.

### Agent Architecture
The agent follows a structured workflow:
- **User Need Assessment**: Gathers and summarizes user preferences.
- **Filter Building**: Constructs and applies search filters.
- **Listing Retrieval**: Collects data from integrated platforms.
- **Insight Delivery**: Provides additional information and recommendations.

### Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduces the time spent searching and comparing products.
- **Clarity**: Summarizes complex data into actionable insights.
- **Flexibility**: Adaptable to various product categories beyond cars.

## Code Setup

The following steps guide you through setting up the necessary environment and running the agent.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.

The project can run on Google Colab or any local Jupyter Notebook environment, but for some reason scraping is very slow on Google Colab.
We recommend running the project on a local Jupyter Notebook environment, preferably on macOS or Linux. If you're using Windows, it's best to run it under WSL for optimal performance.

To start the Gradio interface, just run all the cells in the notebook, then connect to the Gradio interface by clicking the link provided.

You can set USE_GRADIO variable to False to run the project without Gradio interface. This makes it easier to debug and test the project.

Set up the .env file with the necessary API keys:
- OPENAI_API_KEY (required)
- LANGCHAIN_API_KEY (not required if LangSmith is not used)

### Web Scraping and Interface Definitions

This section defines essential functions and classes for interacting with websites, retrieving listings, and applying filters based on user requirements.

1. **`scroll_to_bottom`**:
   - Implements dynamic content loading by scrolling to the bottom of a webpage iteratively, ensuring all elements are loaded before scraping.

2. **`block_unnecessary_resources`**:
   - Improves scraping efficiency by blocking non-essential resources such as images during browser automation.

3. **`WebsiteInterface` Abstract Class**:
   - Serves as a base class for defining web scraper interfaces.
   - Provides structure for crawling websites and managing filters, ensuring consistency across multiple platforms.

4. **`AutotraderInterface`**:
   - A concrete implementation of the `WebsiteInterface` tailored for scraping car listings from AutoTrader.
   - Includes methods for:
     - Retrieving and processing car listings (`crawl`).
     - Fetching detailed information for a specific listing (`crawl_listing`).
     - Constructing filters and generating query URLs dynamically using LLM responses.

The modular design allows for easy addition of new platforms by extending the `WebsiteInterface` class and implementing the required methods.

```

### Load Environment Variables and Set Up API Keys

This cell configures the environment and initializes API keys required for the project:

1. **Load `.env` Variables**:
   - Uses `load_dotenv()` to load sensitive information (like API keys) from a `.env` file.

2. **Configure OpenAI API Key**:
   - Retrieves the `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment or Colab's `userdata` if running in Google Colab.

3. **Set LangChain Configuration**:
   - Disables tracing (`LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2`) and configures the LangChain endpoint and project.

4. **Initialize Clients**:
   - Sets up `GPT` as the model (`gpt-4o-mini`) using `ChatOpenAI`.
   - Creates `langsmith_client` and `openai_client` for managing OpenAI interactions.

```python
# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

try:

### Define the `State` Class

This cell defines the `State` class, which inherits from `MessagesState`, to represent the current state of the car-buying process. It includes:

1. **`user_needs`**: Stores the user's requirements for the car (e.g., budget, features).
2. **`web_interfaces`**: A list of web scraper interfaces (e.g., AutoTrader) to fetch car listings.
3. **`listings`**: A collection of car listings retrieved from the web platforms.
4. **`selected_listing`**: The specific car listing chosen by the user for further exploration.
5. **`additional_info`**: Additional information about the selected car (e.g., common issues, reliability).
6. **`next_node`**: The next action or state transition in the workflow.

```python
class State(MessagesState):
    """Represents the state of the car-buying process."""
    user_needs: str
    web_interfaces: List[WebsiteInterface]
    listings: List[Dict[str, str]]
    selected_listing: Dict[str, str]
    additional_info: Dict[str, str]
    next_node: str

```

### Define Input and Output Helper Functions

1. **`get_user_input`**:
   - A utility function to capture user input during the interaction.
   - It wraps Python’s `input()` function, allowing for optional arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) for flexibility in prompt customization.

2. **`show_assistant_output`**:
   - Displays the assistant's output (e.g., LLM responses) to the user.
   - Uses Python's `print()` function, enabling formatted or contextual responses.


```python
def get_user_input(*args, **kwargs):
    """Get user input."""
    return input(*args, **kwargs)

def show_assistant_output(*args, **kwargs):
    """Show the output of the LLM."""
    print(*args, **kwargs)
```

### Define the `ask_user_needs` Function

This function initiates the process of gathering user requirements for the car-buying assistant. It uses LLM responses to guide the conversation and determine the next steps. Key components include:

1. **State Initialization**:
   - Retrieves previous messages and existing user needs from the `state` object.

2. **Conversation Starter**:
   - Constructs a system message to ask the user about their car requirements (e.g., budget, usage, preferences).

3. **Interaction Handling**:
   - Appends the assistant's and user's messages to the conversation flow using `SystemMessage`, `AIMessage`, and `HumanMessage`.

4. **Summarization**:
   - Summarizes user input into concise points and determines the next step in the workflow:
     - `ask_user_needs`: Collect more details.
     - `build_filters`: Proceed to filtering options.
     - `irrelevant`: Handle unrelated queries.

5. **LLM Integration**:
   - Uses `USER_NEEDS_GPT` (configured with a custom response format) to process user needs and suggest the next action.

6. **Output**:
   - Displays summarized needs and the determined next step to the user.

```python
from typing import TypedDict
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel
import json

class NextStep(Enum):
    ASK_USER_NEEDS = "ask_user_needs"
    BUILD_FILTERS = "build_filters"
    IRRELEVANT = "irrelevant"

class UserNeeds(BaseModel):
    user_needs: str
    next_step: NextStep

USER_NEEDS_GPT = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", response_format=UserNeeds)

def ask_user_needs(state: State) -> State:
    """Ask user initial questions to define their needs for the car."""
    messages = state.get("messages", [])    
    if len(messages) == 0:
        system_message = "You are a car buying assistant. Your goal is to help the user find a car that meets their needs. Start by introducing yourself and asking about their requirements, such as intended usage (e.g., commuting, family trips), budget, size preferences, and any specific constraints or features they value. Use their responses to guide them toward the best options."
    else:
        system_message = "Ask the user for any additional information that can help narrow down the search. If he asked any questions before, answer them before asking for more information. When answering, make sure to provide clear and concise information, with relevant examples."
        
    existing_needs = state.get("user_needs", "")
    if existing_needs:
        system_message += f" Here's what we know about the needs of the user so far:\n\n{existing_needs}"

    messages.append(SystemMessage(content=system_message))

    # Get message from the LLM
    response = GPT.invoke(messages).content
    messages += [AIMessage(response)]
    show_assistant_output(f"\033[92m{messages[-1].content}\033[0m", flush=True)
    
    messages += [HumanMessage(get_user_input(response))]
    print(f"\033[94m{messages[-1].content}\033[0m", flush=True)
    
    summarization_messages = messages.copy()
    
    summarization_messages += [
        SystemMessage(
            "Summarize the user's car-buying needs in clear and concise bullet points based on their input and any prior knowledge.\n"
            "Provide the next step, such as asking for more details or answer questions under ask_user_needs or going forward to build_filter:\n"
            "- Use 'ask_user_needs' if you need more information or if the user asked a question.\n"
            "- Use 'build_filters' if you have enough details to search for cars online.\n"
            "If the user's query is irrelevant to the matter at hand (buying a car), respond 'irrelevant'."
        )
    ]
    
    response = json.loads(USER_NEEDS_GPT.invoke(summarization_messages).content)

    state["user_needs"] = response["user_needs"]
    
    messages += [AIMessage("I have summarized your car-buying needs as follows:\n" + state["user_needs"])]
    
    show_assistant_output(f"\033[92m{messages[-1].content}\033[0m")
    
    state["next_node"] = response["next_step"]
        
    print(f"\nNext node: {state['next_node']}", flush=True)

    return state
```

### Define the `build_filters` Function

This function constructs and refines search filters based on user-provided requirements. It interacts with web scraper interfaces to tailor the search for relevant car listings. Key elements include:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Displays a message indicating the filter-building process has started.

2. **Iterating Over Web Interfaces**:
   - Loops through each scraper in `state["web_interfaces"]` to gather and apply filter options.

3. **Filter Information**:
   - Retrieves filter details from each interface using `get_filters_info()` and incorporates them with the user's needs.

4. **LLM-Assisted Filter Application**:
   - Sends the filter details and user needs to the LLM (`GPT`) for processing.
   - Parses and applies the LLM's response to the interface using `set_filters_from_llm_response()`.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Catches and displays errors (e.g., validation issues or unexpected exceptions) for each interface, ensuring robustness.

6. **Output**:
   - Provides success or failure messages for each interface and displays the updated search URL when filters are successfully applied.


```python
def build_filters(state: State) -> State:
    """Build and refine search filters based on user needs."""

    show_assistant_output("Building filters based on user needs...")
    
    for interface in state["web_interfaces"]:
        filters_info = interface.get_filters_info()
        
        # TODO: Check if this website is useful to the user based on the filters
        # If not continue to the next interface
        
        # If the website is useful, use LLM to setup the filters based on user needs
        
        # Define system instructions with filters information
        system_message = SystemMessage(filters_info + "\n\n" + "User needs:\n" + state["user_needs"])

        # Use the LLM to process the user's needs and set the filters
        try:
            result = GPT.invoke([system_message])
            llm_response = result.content.strip()

            # Validate and set the filters for the interface
            interface.set_filters_from_llm_response(llm_response)
            show_assistant_output(f"\nSuccessfully set filters for: {interface.__class__.__name__}")
            show_assistant_output(f"Updated URL: {interface.url}")
        except ValueError as e:
            show_assistant_output(f"Failed to set filters for {interface.base_url}: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            show_assistant_output(f"An error occurred while processing filters for {interface.base_url}: {e}")
    
    return
```

### Define the `fetch_listings_from_sources` Function

This asynchronous function retrieves car listings from various web interfaces based on the applied filters. Key aspects include:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Simulates the process of fetching car listings, tailored to the filters defined earlier.

2. **Input**:
   - `web_interfaces`: A list of web scraper interfaces (e.g., AutoTrader) that implement the `crawl` method for data retrieval.

3. **Operation**:
   - Iterates over each interface in `web_interfaces` and asynchronously collects listings using `await interface.crawl()`.

4. **Output**:
   - Returns a consolidated list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a car listing

```python
async def fetch_listings_from_sources(web_interfaces: List[WebsiteInterface]) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """Simulate retrieval of car listings from Autotrader.com based on filters.
    
    Args:
        filters (dict): Dictionary containing search filters (e.g., budget, fuel type).
        
    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, each representing a car listing.
    """
    listings = []
    for interface in web_interfaces:
        listings += await interface.crawl()
        
    return listings
```

### Define the `search_listings` Function

This function searches for car listings based on the user's needs and displays the most relevant results. It incorporates user feedback to determine the next step in the workflow.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Adds a system message to indicate the start of the search.
   - Calls `fetch_listings_from_sources` asynchronously to retrieve listings from the web interfaces.

2. **Listing Retrieval**:
   - Uses `asyncio.run()` to fetch listings, stores them in `state["listings"]`, and outputs the total count retrieved.

3. **Display Listings**:
   - Constructs a user-friendly list of the top 5 results, including images, titles, and other details.
   - Prompts the user to select a listing, refine the search, or end the conversation.

4. **User Interaction**:
   - Captures the user's response via the `CLASSIFIER_GPT` model, which categorizes the action (`select_listing`, `refine_search`, or `end_conversation`).
   - Updates the `state["next_node"]` based on the user's choice:
     - `select_listing`: Prepares for detailed exploration of a specific listing.
     - `refine_search`: Returns to the user needs stage.
     - `end_conversation`: Terminates the workflow.

```python
from typing import Literal, Optional

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    action: Literal['select_listing', 'refine_search', 'end_conversation']
    listing_id: Optional[str]

CLASSIFIER_GPT = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", response_format=UserResponse)

def search_listings(state: State) -> State:
    """Search for cars on LaCentrale and mobile.de based on filters."""
    """Display the first listings for the user to view."""
    """Synchronous wrapper for search_listings."""

    state["messages"] += [SystemMessage("Searching for listings based on user needs, this may take time...")]
    show_assistant_output(state["messages"][-1].content)

    async def _search_listings():
        return await fetch_listings_from_sources(state["web_interfaces"])
    
    listings = asyncio.run(_search_listings())
    state["listings"] = listings
    
    show_assistant_output(f"Successfully fetched {len(listings)} listings from the sources.")
    
    AI_message = ""
    
    # Display the first few listings for the user to view
    AI_message += "Here are recent listings that match your requirements:\n"
    for i, listing in enumerate(state["listings"][:5], 1):
        AI_message += f"{i}.\n"
        for key, value in listing.items():
            formatted_key = key.replace("_", " ").capitalize()
            if formatted_key == "Image" and value:
                AI_message += f"   {formatted_key}: ![Example Image]({value})\n"
            else:
                AI_message += f"   {formatted_key}: {value}\n"
        AI_message += "\n"  # Add an extra line for readability
    
    user_prompt = "Would you like to view more details about a specific listing, or refine your search (Write END to finish this conversation) ?"
    AI_message += user_prompt
        
    state["messages"].append(AIMessage(AI_message))
    show_assistant_output(f"\033[92m{state['messages'][-1].content}\033[0m")
    state["messages"].append(HumanMessage(get_user_input(user_prompt)))
    print(f"\033[94m{state['messages'][-1].content}\033[0m")
       
    response = json.loads(CLASSIFIER_GPT.invoke(state["messages"]).content)

    if response["action"] == "select_listing":
        state["next_node"] = "fetch_additional_info"
        selected_listing_id = response["listing_id"]
        for i, listing in enumerate(state["listings"][:5], 1):
            if selected_listing_id in listing["id"]:
                state["selected_listing"] = listing
                break
    elif response["action"] == "refine_search":
        state["next_node"] = "ask_user_needs"
    else:
        state["next_node"] = END
        
    return state
```

### Define the `fetch_additional_info` Function

This function retrieves detailed information about a selected car listing, enhances it with insights from the web, and allows the user to decide the next steps.

1. **Crawl the Car Listing**:
   - Asynchronously fetches additional details about the selected car from its source URL using the appropriate scraper (`crawl_listing`).

2. **Summarize Car Details**:
   - Uses the LLM (`GPT`) to generate a clear and concise summary of the car's details, formatted for readability.

3. **Fetch Web-Based Insights**:
   - Queries DuckDuckGo for information about the car model (e.g., common issues, reliability) and formats the results.

4. **Enhance Context with LLM**:
   - Combines the fetched insights with user needs to generate a comprehensive summary of the car's specifications and general issues.

5. **User Interaction**:
   - Displays the additional information to the user and prompts them to either:
     - View details of another listing (`fetch_additional_info`).
     - Refine their search (`ask_user_needs`).
     - End the conversation.

6. **Workflow Updates**:
   - Updates `state["next_node"]` based on the user's action, ensuring a smooth transition to the next step.


```python
from langchain_community.tools import DuckDuckGoSearchResults

duckduckgo_search = DuckDuckGoSearchResults(max_results=3)

def fetch_additional_info(state: State) -> State:
    """Fetch more details about the selected car listing."""
    listing = state["selected_listing"]

    # Crawl the car listing page to get more details about the car for sale and the seller

    async def _crawl_car_listing():
        for interface in state["web_interfaces"]:
            if listing["id"].split("_")[0].lower() in interface.__class__.__name__.lower():
                return await interface.crawl_listing(listing["url"])
    
    info_car_for_sale = asyncio.run(_crawl_car_listing())

    # Call the LLM to summarize the information about the car for sale into a concise paragraph
    prompt = SystemMessage(
        f"Summarize all the relevant information about the selected car for sale into a paragraph: {listing['title']}\n\n"
        f"Here is the raw information about the car for sale:\n\n{info_car_for_sale}"
        f"Format the summary clearly and concisely, with line breaks between sections."
    )

    car_info_summary = GPT.invoke([prompt]).content

    show_assistant_output("\033[92mHere are more details about the car for sale:\n\033[0m", flush=True)

    show_assistant_output("\033[92m" + car_info_summary + "\n\n\033[0m", flush=True)

    state["messages"] += [prompt, AIMessage(car_info_summary)]

    # Search for common issues and reliability of the car on DuckDuckGo
    car_name = listing["title"]

    queries = [f"{car_name} common issues", f"{car_name} problem", f"{car_name} reliability"]
    context = ""
    for query in queries:
        search_results = duckduckgo_search.invoke(query)
        formatted_results = f"QUERY: {query}\n\n{search_results}\n-------------------\n"
        context += formatted_results

    prompt = SystemMessage(
        f"Provide additional information about this car: {listing['title']}, "
        f"including engine specifications, common issues with this model, and market value."
        f"Here is additioanl context to help you provide the information:\n\n{context}"
        f"Here are the user needs, give some insights about the car based on the user needs:\n\n{state['user_needs']}"
    )
    
    result = GPT.invoke([prompt])
    
    listing["additional_info"] = result.content
    
    show_assistant_output(f"\033[92mHere is additional information about the model in general, coming from Internet:\n{listing['additional_info']}\n\033[0m")
    
    user_prompt = "Would you like to view more details about another listing, or refine your search (Write END to finish this conversation) ?"
    state["messages"] += [SystemMessage(user_prompt)]
    state["messages"] += [HumanMessage(get_user_input(user_prompt))]
    print(f"\033[94m{state['messages'][-1].content}\033[0m", flush=True)
    
    response = json.loads(CLASSIFIER_GPT.invoke(state["messages"]).content)

    if response["action"] == "select_listing":
        state["next_node"] = "fetch_additional_info"
        selected_listing_id = response["listing_id"]
        for i, listing in enumerate(state["listings"][:5], 1):
            if selected_listing_id in listing["id"]:
                state["selected_listing"] = listing
                break
    elif response["action"] == "refine_search":
        state["next_node"] = "ask_user_needs"
    else:
        state["next_node"] = END
    
    return state
```

### Initialize and Define the Workflow Graph

This cell sets up the state-based workflow using `StateGraph` from `langgraph`. It defines the nodes, edges, and conditional logic for navigating through the car-buying assistant's process.

1. **Initialize the Workflow**:
   - The `StateGraph` object is created with the `State` class to manage the workflow state.

2. **Define Nodes**:
   - Each step in the workflow is represented as a node:
     - `ask_user_needs`: Gathers user requirements.
     - `build_filters`: Constructs search filters.
     - `search_listings`: Retrieves car listings.
     - `fetch_additional_info`: Provides detailed information about a selected car.
     - `irrelevant`: Handles unrelated queries.

3. **Set Workflow Edges**:
   - Nodes are connected based on the possible transitions:
     - Conditional transitions from `ask_user_needs` depend on the next step (`build_filters`, `ask_user_needs`, or `irrelevant`).
     - `build_filters` transitions directly to `search_listings`.
     - Conditional transitions from `search_listings` determine whether to fetch more details, return to user needs, or end the workflow.
     - The `irrelevant` node ends the workflow.

4. **Entry and Exit Points**:
   - The workflow begins at the `ask_user_needs` node.
   - Conditional edges from `fetch_additional_info` allow for revisiting user needs, exploring more details, or ending the workflow.

5. **Compile the Workflow**:
   - The workflow is compiled into an executable application (`app`), ready to process user queries.


```python
# Initialize the StateGraph
workflow = StateGraph(State)

# Define the nodes in the graph
workflow.add_node("ask_user_needs", ask_user_needs)
workflow.add_node("build_filters", build_filters)
workflow.add_node("search_listings", search_listings)
workflow.add_node("fetch_additional_info", fetch_additional_info)
workflow.add_node("irrelevant", lambda state: state)

# Define edges
workflow.add_conditional_edges("ask_user_needs", lambda state: state["next_node"], ["build_filters", "ask_user_needs", "irrelevant"])
workflow.add_edge("build_filters", "search_listings")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("search_listings", lambda state: state["next_node"], ["fetch_additional_info", "ask_user_needs", END])
workflow.add_edge("irrelevant", END)

# Set the entry and exit points
workflow.set_entry_point("ask_user_needs")
workflow.add_conditional_edges("fetch_additional_info", lambda state: state["next_node"], ["ask_user_needs", "fetch_additional_info", END])


# Compile the workflow
app = workflow.compile()
```

### Visualize the Workflow Graph

This cell generates and displays a visual representation of the workflow using Mermaid.js. The graph shows the nodes and their connections, providing a clear overview of the assistant's structure.

1. **Generate Graph**:
   - The `draw_mermaid_png` method from `MermaidDrawMethod.API` creates a PNG image of the workflow graph.

2. **Display Graph**:
   - The `Image` function renders the generated PNG, enabling visualization of the nodes (states) and edges (transitions).


```python
display(
    Image(
        app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png(
            draw_method=MermaidDrawMethod.API,
        )
    )
)
```

### Define `run_car_buyer_agent` Function

This function initializes and executes the car-buying assistant workflow using the compiled LangGraph application.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Creates an empty `messages` list to store the conversation history.

2. **Set Initial State**:
   - Defines the `initial_state` object with the following:
     - `user_needs`: Empty, awaiting user input.
     - `web_interfaces`: A list containing the `AutotraderInterface` for scraping car listings.
     - `listings`, `selected_listing`, `additional_info`: Empty placeholders to be populated during the workflow.
     - `next_node`: Empty, to be updated dynamically.
     - `messages`: Tracks messages exchanged between the assistant and the user.

3. **Run Workflow**:
   - Invokes the workflow using `app.invoke()` with the initialized state.

4. **Output**:
   - Returns the final `result` after executing the workflow.


```python
# Verify initial setup and function invocation
def run_car_buyer_agent():
    """Run the car-buying assistant with LangGraph."""
        
    messages = []
    
    initial_state = State(
        user_needs={}, 
        web_interfaces=[AutotraderInterface()], 
        listings=[],
        selected_listing={}, 
        additional_info={},
        next_node="",
        messages=messages
    )
    result = app.invoke(initial_state)
    return result
```

### Conditional Execution Without Gradio

This cell provides a fallback mechanism to run the car-buying assistant in a command-line environment if the `USE_GRADIO` flag is set to `False`.

1. **Define Input/Output Functions**:
   - `get_user_input`: Captures user input via the terminal using `input()`.
   - `show_assistant_output`: Displays the assistant's output using `print()`.

2. **Execute the Agent**:
   - Calls the `run_car_buyer_agent()` function to initiate the workflow and stores the result in `car_buyer_result`.

3. **Debugging Output**:
   - Prints the raw result of the workflow execution for inspection.

4. **Display Final Recommendation**:
   - If a car listing is selected:
     - Outputs the title, price, and mileage of the recommended car.
     - Prints additional details retrieved during the workflow.
   - If no listing is selected, informs the user.


```python
USE_GRADIO = True

if not USE_GRADIO:
    def get_user_input(*args, **kwargs):
        """Get user input."""
        return input(*args, **kwargs)

    def show_assistant_output(*args, **kwargs):
        """Show the output of the LLM."""
        print(*args, **kwargs)

    # Execute the agent
    car_buyer_result = run_car_buyer_agent()

    # Print result for debugging purposes
    print("Car Buyer Result:", car_buyer_result)

    # Display summary of the final recommendation
    if "selected_listing" in car_buyer_result:
        listing = car_buyer_result["selected_listing"]
        print(f"\nFinal Recommendation:\n{listing['title']} - {listing['price']} - {listing['mileage']} km")
        print("Additional Information:")
        for key, value in car_buyer_result["additional_info"].items():

### Gradio Interface and Threaded Execution

This cell sets up a **Gradio-based chatbot interface** for the car-buying assistant, enabling user interaction via a web-based GUI.

#### Key Components:

1. **Input and Output Queues**:
   - `InputQueue`:
     - Simulates `stdin` behavior by queuing user inputs for asynchronous processing.
   - `output_queue`:
     - Stores the assistant's responses for incremental display in the UI.

2. **Input/Output Functions**:
   - `get_user_input`:
     - Waits for and retrieves user input from the `input_queue`.
   - `show_assistant_output`:
     - Formats and sends assistant responses to the `output_queue`.

3. **Agent Interaction**:
   - `interact_with_agent`:
     - Processes user messages, sends them to the agent, and retrieves responses incrementally for a seamless conversational flow.
   - `get_initial_message`:
     - Captures the initial response from the agent to display upon starting the interface.

4. **Threaded Execution**:
   - `run_langgraph_agent`:
     - Executes the LangGraph-based workflow in a separate thread to allow non-blocking interaction in the Gradio interface.

5. **Gradio Interface**:
   - `gr.ChatInterface`:
     - Creates a real-time chat interface with the following configurations:
       - `interact_with_agent`: Handles message exchanges.
       - `chatbot`: Configures the chat window's appearance and behavior.

6. **Execution Flow**:
   - If `USE_GRADIO` is `True`:
     - Starts the agent in a separate thread.
     - Initializes the Gradio interface with the assistant's initial message and launches it.
