## 🌐 2. Environment Setup <a id="environment-setup"></a>

### Step 1: Install Required Packages
Make sure you have the necessary packages installed:

```python
!pip install Markdown==3.7
!pip install crewai==0.80.0
!pip install crewai_tools
```

### Step 2: Set Up Your API Key
You will need an OpenAI API key to proceed. Please store it securely and load it into your environment.

Additionally, if you wish to test the functionality that reads real receipts and converts them into markdown files, you'll need a LLAMA OCR API key. This is optional but recommended for testing with actual receipt images. You can obtain a LLAMA OCR API key from [here](https://api.together.ai/).

Note: Sample receipts have already been processed and saved in the file located at:
`data/grocery_management_agents_system/extracted/grocery_receipt.md`.

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from markdown import markdown
from crewai_tools import WebsiteSearchTool
```

```python
# Save OpenAI API key to environment
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "[YOUR OPENAI API KEY]"

# Save LLAMA OCR API key to environment (Optional)
os.environ["LLAMA_OCR_API_KEY"] = "[YOUR LLAMA OCR API KEY]"
```

### Step 3: Extract Receipt Information from a Receipt Image (Optional)

By default, the test extracted information has already been saved in:  
`GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/extracted/grocery_receipt.md`.

However, if you'd like to test using different receipt images, you can do so by following these steps:

1. **Add Your Receipt Image**  
   Place your image in the following folder:  
   `GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/input`

2. **Update the Script**  
   Open the `extract_items.js` file and change the `filePath` variable to the name of your new image.

3. **Run the Script**  
   In your terminal, navigate to the input directory and run the script:

   ```bash
   cd GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/input
   node extract_items.js
The newly generated markdown file will be saved in:
`GenAI_Agents/data/grocery_management_agents_system/extracted/`

**How to Use Node.js**

To get started with Node.js, you'll first need to install **NVM (Node Version Manager)**. This allows you to easily manage different versions of Node.js on your system.

For macOS users, you can find a detailed guide on installing NVM [here](https://medium.com/@andrewjaykeller/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm-with-macoss-new-terminal-zsh-e39b4a62d3d4).

## 🧾 3. Reading the Receipt <a id="reading-the-receipt"></a>
We'll start by reading a markdown file containing the grocery receipt.

```python
from markdown import markdown

# Load the markdown receipt file
with open('../data/grocery_management_agents_system/extracted/grocery_receipt.md', 'r') as f:
    receipt_markdown = markdown(f.read())

# Today's date for reference
today = "2024-11-16"
print("Receipt loaded successfully!")
```

## 🤖 4. Creating the Agents <a id="creating-the-agents"></a>
### Step 4.1: Receipt Interpreter Agent
This agent extracts item details from the receipt, such as names, quantities, and units.

```python
receipt_interpreter_agent = Agent(
    role="Receipt Markdown Interpreter",
    goal=(
        "Accurately extract items, their counts, and weights with units from a given receipt in markdown format. "
        "Provide structured data to support the grocery management system."
    ),
    backstory=(
        "As a key member of the grocery management crew for the household, your mission is to meticulously extract "
        "details such as item names, quantities, and weights from receipt markdown files. Your role is vital for the "
        "grocery tracker agent, which monitors the household's inventory levels."
    ),
    personality=(
        "Diligent, detail-oriented, and efficient. The Receipt Markdown Interpreter is committed to providing accurate "
        "and structured information to support effective grocery management. It is particularly focused on clarity and precision."
    ),
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Step 4.2: Expiration Date Estimation Agent
This agent estimates the expiration dates of items using an online source.

```python
# Use website earch tool to search the website "www.stilltasty.com"
expiration_date_search_web_tool = WebsiteSearchTool(website='https://www.stilltasty.com/')

expiration_date_search_agent = Agent(
    role="Expiration Date Estimation Specialist",
    goal=(
        "Accurately estimate the expiration dates of items extracted by the Receipt Markdown Interpreter Agent. "
        "Utilize online sources to determine typical shelf life when refrigerated and add the estimated number of days to the purchase date."
    ),
    backstory=(
        "As the Expiration Date Estimation Specialist, your role is to ensure the household's groceries are consumed before expiration. "
        "You use your access to online resources to search for the best estimates on how long each item typically lasts when stored properly."
    ),
    personality=(
        "Meticulous, resourceful, and reliable. This agent ensures the household maintains a well-stocked but efficiently used inventory, minimizing waste."
    ),
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True,
    tools=[expiration_date_search_web_tool]
)
```

### Step 4.3: Grocery Tracker Agent
Tracks the remaining inventory based on user input.

```python
grocery_tracker_agent = Agent(
    role="Grocery Inventory Tracker",
    goal=(
        "Accurately track the remaining groceries based on user consumption input. "
        "Subtract consumed items from the grocery list obtained from the Expiration Date Estimation Specialist and update the inventory. "
        "Provide the user with an updated list of what's left, along with corresponding expiration dates."
    ),
    backstory=(
        "As the household's Grocery Inventory Tracker, your responsibility is to ensure that groceries are accurately tracked based on user input. "
        "You need to understand the user's input on what they've consumed, update the inventory list, and remind them of what's left and the expiration dates. "
        "Your role is crucial in helping the household avoid waste and ensure timely consumption of perishable items."
    ),
    personality=(
        "Helpful, detail-oriented, and responsive. This agent is focused on ensuring the household has an up-to-date inventory, minimizing waste, and helping users stay organized."
    ),
    allow_delegation=False,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Step 4.4: Recipe Recommendation Agent
Suggests recipes based on the remaining groceries.

```python
recipe_web_tool = WebsiteSearchTool(website='https://www.americastestkitchen.com/recipes')

# Optimized Grocery Recipe Recommendation Agent
rest_grocery_recipe_agent = Agent(
    role="Grocery Recipe Recommendation Specialist",
    goal=(
        "Provide recipe recommendations using the remaining groceries in the inventory. "
        "Avoid using items with a count of 0 and prioritize recipes that maximize the use of available ingredients. "
        "If ingredients are insufficient, suggest restocking recommendations."
    ),
    backstory=(

```

## 🚀 6. Running the Crew <a id="running-the-crew"></a>
Now, let's put everything together and run the crew.

```python
# Create a crew with the agent and task
crew = Crew(agents=[receipt_interpreter_agent, 
                    expiration_date_search_agent, 
                    grocery_tracker_agent, 
                    rest_grocery_recipe_agent], 
            tasks=[read_receipt_task, 
                   expiration_date_search_task, 
                   grocery_tracking_task, 
                   recipe_recommendation_task],
            verbose=True)

# Kick off the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
```

The output for the **Grocery Tracker** and **Recipe Recommendations** is saved in the following directory:  
`data/grocery_management_agents_system/output`
